# PIC10C-finalproject

This is my final project for PIC 10C; it's my learning how to use Jupyter Notebook and Python to do data analysis.
I started by learning how to use Jupyter with some tutorials, then went on to analyze a dataset that I found interesting.

Here's a general log of what I did:

**May 17:** To download Jupyter Notebook, I first had to download Miniconda. I ran into some issues with local repositories
and creating my folder, but eventually got both downloaded and working.

**May 18:** Initial Commit & Hello, World in Jupyter Notebook

**May 19:** Reviewed some Markdown and started this README ! I also planned how I would be breaking up the tutorials I was going to follow.
They can be found here:
1. [Munging Data](http://wavedatalab.github.io/datawithpython/munge.html)
2. [Aggregating Data](http://wavedatalab.github.io/datawithpython/aggregate.html)
3. [Visualizing Data](http://wavedatalab.github.io/datawithpython/visualize.html)
4. [Time Series](http://wavedatalab.github.io/datawithpython/timeseries.html)

**May 20:** First tutorial: Munging Data

**May 24:** Second tutorial: Aggregating Data
